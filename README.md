Tools for dealing with [IML-Resi PowerDrill](https://www.iml-service.com/product/iml-powerdrill/) data using python.

**THIS PACKAGE IS UNOFFICAL AND HAS BEEN DEVELOPED INDEPENDENT OF IML**

Current limitations:

1. Focus is on actual measurements made by the tool rather than meta-info.
1. Poor support for data generated in PD-Tools (e.g. "assessments").
